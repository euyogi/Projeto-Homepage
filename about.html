                    <p>
                        I am a brazilian student that loves programming, and I am taking
                        the CS50 Course before I enter in university, and it is wonderful course indeed. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why the page</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of CS50's problem sets is creating a homepage about something. It could
                        be about myself, or some hobbie, or anything else that I have
                        some interest, so I thought about Minecraft, because it is a game
                        that I played a lot when I was younger, and had a lot of fun with
                        people across my country, could live some wonderful experiences
                        in some servers that probably does not even exists anymore.
                        As there is some time that I do not play, it is possible that
                        the game changed a lot and it lost some of that essence of the past.
                        But it will be forever something that was part of my life and I
                        really liked the gold times expend in it :)
