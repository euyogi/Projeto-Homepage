                    <p>
                        [Minecraft] - the word has it origins traced back to
                        the english language, result of combining two words:
                        [Mine] and [Craft], and those two words defines
                        the foundation of this wonderful game, that is,
                        mining and crafting.

                    <h2>What is it</h2>
                    <p>
                        Minecraft is a sandbox game where you can create your 
                        own worlds and experiences using building blocks and
                        resources. It is available on multiple platforms such
                        as computers, smartphones, tablets and consoles.
                        <br><br>
                        But actually, that definition is a little lame, so let's
                        try again.
                        <br><br>
                        Minecraft is a game that combines elements of multiple
                        types of games as construction, exploration, survival
                        and adventure. The thing is that it does in a fully modifiable three-dimensional procedurally
                        generated world, that is it's a random world every time
                        you create a new one, so the gameplay is never the same.
                        And the world is infinite! Ok, maybe not infinite but it
                        is. Definitely one of the funniest games to play with friends.

                                            The game has achievements so even though the game does not tell you the objective is accomplish those achievements and in the process kill the bosses
                                            like the EnderDragon or the Wither. You can die as many times as you want but you could lose your items in the process.

                            Minecraft was created by Markus Persson, a Swedish

                            programmer, designer, genius, billionaire,
                            playboy and a philanthropist. Who is also known as Notch.

                            He and his team worked on the game at Mojang Studios until 2014, when the game was sold to Microsoft for U$ 2.5 billion.

                            Notch has since left Mojang and is no longer working in the game.
